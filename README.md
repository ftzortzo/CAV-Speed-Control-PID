# CAV-Speed-Control-PID
A minimal MATLAB example of speed control in a Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) using a PID controller. Simulates a vehicle as a double integrator and regulates its speed to a desired value. Designed for educational use and easy experimentation.

## Introduction to PID controller
A PID controller is a type of feedback control mechanism widely used in engineering systems to regulate processes.

PID stands for:

P: Proportional

I: Integral

D: Derivative

The controller takes in the error between a desired reference value and the actual system output and uses that to compute a control action.
